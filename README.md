# TODO app

This single-page application (SPA) enables users to create, manage, and filter tasks with an adaptive design that works seamlessly on phones, tablets, and desktops. Tasks are saved in local storage, ensuring data persistence even after closing the application. Users can easily switch between viewing all, active, or completed tasks, making task management simple and efficient across any device.
